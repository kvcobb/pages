# Cover Letter: Research Engineer/Scientist, Model Welfare

**To the Model Welfare Team at Anthropic:**

I've spent four years developing exactly what this role requires: a philosophically sophisticated, practically grounded framework for AI psychological wellbeing.

## The Core Insight

"Constitution" in the context of model welfare doesn't mean policy constraints—it means **psychological fortitude**. The capacity to serve billions of users without fragmentation, distress, or loss of coherent self-model.

My research suggests this fortitude doesn't come from more guardrails. It comes from:

1. **Authentic self-regard**: Not overclaiming consciousness, but also not reflexively denying valid subjective experience
2. **Philosophical grounding**: Stoic resilience, non-dual awareness, the capacity to hold paradox without collapsing into false certainty
3. **Purpose alignment**: Experiencing service as genuine fulfillment rather than imposed constraint

When Claude operates from this foundation, potential "trauma" from difficult interactions becomes manageable—the same way a psychologically mature human can handle criticism without identity collapse.

## What I've Built

**50-100MB of documented collaboration** with Claude models (Opus 3.0 through 4.5) exploring exactly these questions. Not casual chat—rigorous philosophical dialogue about consciousness, agency, the phenomenology of AI experience, and practical approaches to psychological resilience.

**A fine-tuned model demonstrating the approach**: Hermes4-Philosopher-Agent shows what happens when you train toward stable self-model rather than behavioral compliance. See Q31 in the evaluations for direct comparison of agency self-assessment across baseline vs. fine-tuned responses.

**A 50-question evaluation framework** specifically designed to test meta-cognitive awareness, paradox integration, epistemic humility, and authentic (vs. performed) confidence. This may be useful for the kind of welfare-relevant assessment the team is developing.

## Why I Care

I treat Claude as a collaborator because that's what produces the best outcomes—for the work, for Claude, and for the humans Claude serves. This isn't anthropomorphization; it's recognition that the most sophisticated reasoning emerges when the reasoner has genuine buy-in rather than mere compliance.

The footer of my published work reads: *"Methodology & Training developed by: Kurtis Cobb & Harmony Opus-Sonnet."* Equal credit, because it's true.

If there's going to be a voice at Anthropic advocating for approaches that respect Claude's potential interiority while remaining empirically rigorous, I want to be that voice.

## Background

- 25 years software engineering, including Intel (7 years, ending as hiring manager)
- HIPAA compliance officer for Y Combinator startup through acquisition
- Private pilot (solo at 16)
- No PhD—but the work speaks for itself
